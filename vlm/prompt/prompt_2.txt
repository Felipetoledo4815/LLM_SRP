### Definitions:
1. **ego**: The vehicle holding the camera and capturing the scene (not visible in the image).
2. **stop_sign**: Refers to a traffic control device that warns drivers to slow down and prepare to stop. Itâ€™s used when there are no other cars around, or at the end of a line of traffic. It is a red colored sign with the word STOP written in it. It has a round or octagonal shape.
- Positional: `in_front_of`, `to_left_of`, `to_right_of`
- Distance-based: `within_25m` (within 25 meters), `between_25m_and_40m` (between 25 and 40 meters), `between_40m_and_60m` (between 40 and 60 meters)

### Instructions:
1. Identify all stop_sign in the scene. Do not include stop_sign that are not present.
2. For each stop_sign, generate two RELATIONSHIPS with the ego:
- One positional RELATIONSHIP (`in_front_of`, `to_left_of`, `to_right_of`)
- One distance-based RELATIONSHIP (`within_25m`, `between_25m_and_40m`, `between_40m_and_60m`)
3. Use the following structured format for your output.
4. Verify that each stop_sign is clearly visible and identifiable in the image before including it in the output.
5. Do not include any stop_sign if it is not fully visible

### Output Template:
```
[
"Yes, there is a stop sign in the image. It is located near the top-left corner, has a red octagonal shape, and the word 'STOP' is written in white letters."
...
]
```

### Example:
Given an image with one stop_sign on the right of EGO, the output should be:
```
[
"Yes, there is a stop sign in the image. It is located on the right of EGO, has a red octagonal shape, and the word 'STOP' is written in white letters."
]
```
If no stop_sign is in the scene, the output should be
NO STOP SIGN

### Important:
- Do not include any stop_sign that are not visible in the scene.
- Ensure that all identified stop_sign are clearly distinguishable and relevant.
- Verify the presence and relevance of each stop_sign before including it in the output.
